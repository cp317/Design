<h3><span id="1.5">Overview</span></h3>
This document is written adhering to the guidelines outlined by the IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Design Descriptions. 

<h2><span id="2.0">Decomposition Description</span></h2>
This section shows the decomposition of the system in 3 ways:
-	Module decomposition is the breakdown of each module, the data and functions of each class is easy to change, reuse and comprehend
-	Concurrent process decomposition explains what the user will be able to see on each page
-	Data decomposition explains what is used to store the persistent data.

Package Diagrams
The design of Study Space separates the front end and back end.
/////insert diagram
<h3><span id="2.2">Concurrent Process Decomposition</span></h3>
<h4><span id="2.2.1">HomeWindow</span></h4>
The main view for the site. It contains a map on the right side which allows for easy selection of beacon locations. It has fields for user to input school, course ID, location, date, start time, end time, and tags for filtering purposes. It will contain a list of active beacons that abide by the filters set which can be joined. Finally, it shall also have a login button at the top right corner.
<h4><span id="2.2.2">LoginWindow</span></h4>
Contains the fields for Registered Users to input an email and password. Also gives users the option to register for an account. The input fields will be: Email, Confirm Email, Password, Confirm Password. 
<h4><span id="2.2.3">BeaconCreationWindow</span></h4>
Contains the same view as HomeWindow but the list of beacons to join is gone and the input fields are shifted down to be centered relative to the map. These input fields will be used to set the attributes for the Beacon that is being created. Beacon creation will be finalized by clicking a “Confirm Beacon Creation” button.
<h4><span id="2.2.4">ClassDiscoveryWindow</span></h4>
Contains a list of courses with their respective ratings, quick description and a link to the school page that describes the course.
<h4><span id="2.2.5">UserDiscoveryWindow</span></h4>
Contains a list of Registered Users. Each registered user listed will also show their profile name, the gravitar they set, and a description of themselves that they have also set.
<h4><span id="2.2.6">ChatWindow</span></h4>
A small window at the bottom right corner of the screen that can be used to chat with others.
<h4><span id="2.2.7">NavigationBar</span></h4>
A search bar that will be at the top of each page.
<h3><span id="2.3">Data Decomposition</span></h3>
All data will be handled by a real-time server which is hosted using Firebase. Data will be validated locally, and then sent to the server in JSON format. The server will then store the data in the database in JSON format. A unique key will be generated for each piece of data pushed to the server, and this will allow easy referencing of the correct JSON objects.

<h3><span id="4.1">Module Detailed Design</span></h3>
This section provides a detailed look on module design. It provides steps to produce the intended output of each module in pseudocode. This Pseudocode will be useful for implementation as it provides an outline of which can be referenced when developing the product in code.

<h3><span id="4.2">Documentation</span></h3>
<b>Angular</b>
Angular is an open-source front-end platform used to build web applications. It is maintained by Google, and was developed with the goal of minimizing size and maximizing performance of web applications. It is TypeScript based, meaning applications developed in angular can be coded in JavaScript.

Angular has been chosen for the implementation of Study Space because it is robust and excels in the development of data-driven applications. It provides libraries that will make difficult operations such as data binding much easier. It allows for plenty of code reuse, and applications developed with Angular can be viewed on multiple platforms.  Finally, Angular is well documented and easy to learn; There are plenty of resources online that can be accessed, including Tutorials on the Angular website.
 
<br>
<br>
<b>Materialize</b>
Materialize is a CSS framework that allows attractive front end design for webpages. It was created by Google, and allows a unified user experience across many platforms. Materialize will be useful in styling the Study Space web application with a modern look and feel, as well as the implementation of self-evident features.
<br>
<br>
<b>Google Maps Api</b>
The Google Maps API is a service which allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their websites and applications. This API was chosen to implement the map for Study Space because Google is the leading innovator in web mapping technology, and it is a service that all users of the application will be familiar with.  The Google Maps API also provides a plethora of documentation which makes learning to work with it much easier.
<br>
<br>
<b>Node.js</b>
Node.js is an open source, cross-platform javascript runtime environment for executing javascript code server-side. Node.js is particularly useful because the same language can be used on the front end and back end of development, which makes development much less trivial in general. It is event driven while also supporting asynchronous I/O which suits the needs of the Study Space application nicely.
<br>
<br>
<b>Firebase</b>
Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform owned and maintained by Google. All data in Firebase databases is stored as JSON objects. For Study Space, Firebase will be used to provide a realtime database to store information on user credentials, chat logs, active beacons, and more. Overall, it is a very functional platform that will allow the Study Space team to be productive during the implementation of the project.
